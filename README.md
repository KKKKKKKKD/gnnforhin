####>>This is the reading list for paper sharing in our weekly meeting. The topics are mainly related to heterogeneous Graph neural network(GNN) models, Heterogeneous Network Embedding, GNN based explainers. The papers are collected from top conferences within two years. Our list is still incomplete and the categorization might be inappropriate. We will keep adding papers and improving the list. Any suggestions are welcome!
